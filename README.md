# datascience_projects
Here are some notebooks from various Data Science projects done through courses as well as independent projects.

House Sales.ipynb - In this notebook I did some explanatory data analysis exercises with house sales data from Kings County, WA.  After the explanatory data analysis we developed a Linear Regression Model to predict house prices, evaluated the model then refined it to increase the accuracy of our predictions.

Machine Learning Final Project - In this notebook I analyzed a dataset that includes details of 346 customers whose loans are already paid off or defaulted. After some data visualization and pre-processing, I built a few different classification models to predict the probability of a loan defaulting.  These models include a Decision Tree Classifier, Support Vector Machine, Logistic Regression and K Nearest Neighbor.

Segementing and Clustering Toronto - In this project, I was required to explore, segment and cluster different neighborhoods in Toronto.  Unlike earlier projects in the IBM course, the data was not readily available.  I had to scrape the the Toronto Wikipedia page for the information I needed, wrangle and clean the data, then read it into a pandas DataFrame.
